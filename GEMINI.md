I have a website built using Vite.js and Tailwind CSS, currently optimized for desktop browsers. I need you to make the entire website fully responsive and mobile-friendly, with special care for usability, accessibility, and performance on phones and tablets.
Please use Tailwind‚Äôs mobile-first utilities and apply changes across all relevant components, sections, and pages. Here are the specific tasks and requirements:
‚úÖ Layout & Structure
Use flex or grid utilities to restructure layouts for small screens.
Wrap content in responsive containers using max-w- and w-full.
Ensure that padding and margins (px-, py-, m-, gap-) scale well from sm: up to xl:.
Prevent horizontal scrolling and content overflow.
‚úÖ Navigation (Navbar / Sidebar)
Convert any desktop navbars into mobile-friendly hamburger menus.
Use Headless UI or other mobile-accessible dropdown solutions.
Ensure that the menu opens and closes properly on mobile, supports touch, and is accessible via keyboard (ARIA roles as needed).
‚úÖ Typography & Touch Targets
Scale text sizes using responsive classes like text-sm, md:text-base, lg:text-xl, etc.
Ensure all clickable elements (buttons, links, icons) have a minimum tap area (at least h-12 w-12 or similar).
Use hover: and focus: states, but don‚Äôt rely on hover-only interactions for core functionality.
‚úÖ Images and Media
Make all images fully responsive using Tailwind's utility classes like w-full, object-cover, aspect-video, etc.
Use srcset or multiple image sizes for performance if needed.
Use lazy loading where appropriate to improve mobile loading speed.
‚úÖ Forms & Inputs
Style form elements (input, select, textarea, button) for comfortable mobile usage.
Use responsive layout for forms (e.g., stacked on mobile, inline on desktop).
Apply Tailwind focus and spacing utilities for clean UI.
Use mobile-optimized input types (email, tel, number, etc.).
‚úÖ Breakpoints & Responsiveness
Use Tailwind‚Äôs breakpoint prefixes:
sm: for ‚â•640px
md: for ‚â•768px
lg: for ‚â•1024px
xl: for ‚â•1280px
Ensure that all sections of the site (hero, cards, footers, etc.) adapt gracefully.
Use hidden, block, flex, and grid conditionally with breakpoints.
‚úÖ Meta & Viewport
Confirm the following tag is present in the index.html:
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
‚úÖ Performance & UX
Use Tailwind‚Äôs utility-first classes to avoid unnecessary global CSS.
Eliminate layout shift on mobile by setting fixed heights or aspect ratios.
Optimize loading speed by:
Lazy-loading images
Minimizing DOM elements
Reducing JavaScript on initial load
‚úÖ Testing & Validation
Test responsiveness in:
Chrome/Firefox responsive dev tools
iPhone/Android screen sizes (320px, 375px, 414px, 768px, etc.)
Both portrait and landscape
Check with tools like:
Chrome Lighthouse (Mobile mode)
Responsively App (optional)
‚úÖ Optional Enhancements
Sticky header on scroll (sticky top-0 z-50)
Scroll-to-top button for long pages
dark: mode support for better readability at night
Add smooth scroll: scroll-smooth and duration- utilities
üîÅ Final Note:
Refactor all necessary .vue or .js/.jsx components and .html templates within the Vite project. Prefer Tailwind‚Äôs mobile-first classes instead of writing custom CSS unless absolutely required.
Deliver a site that is visually polished, responsive, touch-optimized, and ready for production on all devices.
